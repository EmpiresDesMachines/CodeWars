/*
Spin-off of this kata, here you will have to figure out an efficient strategy to solve the problem of finding the sole duplicate number among an unsorted array/list of numbers starting from 1 up to n.

Hints: a solution in linear time can be found; using the most intuitive ones to search for duplicates that can run in O(nÂ²) time won't work.

const findDup = function (arr) {
  const hash = {};

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (!hash[arr[i]]) {
      hash[arr[i]] = true;
    } else {
      return arr[i];
    }
  }
};
