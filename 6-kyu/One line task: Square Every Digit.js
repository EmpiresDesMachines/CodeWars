/*
Inspired by Square Every Digit and by the inimitable myjinxin2015's many clever one-line katas

Your goal here is precisely the same: square every digit of the given integer, in as few characters as possible.

Your return value should be in integer format. Your input will always be a valid, non-negative integer, may be > 231

Code size limit: 36 characters or less

Examples
0     -->  0
64    -->  3616
1111  -->  1111
2222  -->  4444
3333  -->  9999
3212  -->  9414
1234  -->  14916
77455754  -->  4949162525492516
99999999  -->  8181818181818181
P.S., if you can get the sample tests to pass while under the character limit, the full tests should pass without a hitch!

Have fun, and please upvote if you enjoyed it :)

Found this one too easy? This one's a bit more difficult!
